# web-shop
WebShop faculty project 

In this student project I worked on, I created the backend using ASP .NET Core Web API and the frontend using React. The application supports user authentication and authorization, CRUD database functionality, microservices architecture, data validation on both the client and server sides, as well as the use of external API services. By developing this project, I learned how to create a fully functional web application.
